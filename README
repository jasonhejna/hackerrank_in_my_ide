Tutorial:
    1) make sure you have your language of choice installed
    2) take the code sample from hackerrank and paste it into your file (ex: javascript.js)
    3) copy the input data hackerrank wants us to use into the stdin.dat file
    4) run: issue the command for the language you're using (ex: cat stdin.dat | node javascript.js)
    5) write your code in the file (ex: javascript.js), and code luck with the code test!


DEPENDENCIES:
    unix based os
    languge(s) you'll be using (in my case it's nodejs, and python3)


COMMANDS:
    we're going to cat our stdin.dat file, and stream the contents to our script

    javascript:
        cat stdin.dat | node javascript.js

    python:
        cat stdin.dat | python python.py
        note: use sys.stdin.readline() instead of input(). Will work the same on hackerrank.
